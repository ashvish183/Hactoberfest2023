##Hacktoberfest - 2023

This repository contains code for various data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems.

The following are some of the problems that are solved in this repository:

* Adding two arrays
* Deleting a node in a linked list
* Implementing a hashmap
* Finding the number of good pairs in an array
* Implementing polymorphism
* Adding elements to an array
* Traversing a binary tree
* Deleting a node in a linked list
* Merging two linked lists
* Reversing a queue

This repository is a great resource for anyone who is interested in learning about DSA. The code is well-written and easy to understand, and the problems that are solved are challenging and interesting. I encourage you to contribute to this repository and help make it even better.

In addition, this repository is a great way to contribute to Hacktoberfest 2023. 
Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software.
